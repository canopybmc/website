# Governance

Canopy is governed as a **community-led open-source project**. We aim to ensure transparency, fairness, and long-term sustainability. The project is steered by a **Council** that sets direction, resolves disputes, and guides the evolution of the Canopy ecosystem.

## The Canopy Council

The Canopy Council is the primary decision-making body for the project. It consists of trusted contributors with diverse backgrounds in firmware development, security, and community building.
